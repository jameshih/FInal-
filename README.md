Run `node compile.js` to get a json abi file in /build folder

Run `node deploy.js` to deploy contract to rinkeby

Don't forget to set private key in deploy.js

Rinkeby deployed contract `0x73A2a7f2614364caC1B6223bc311DccB598b5FDD`

The contract owner and validator are both set to `0x1d80D29D0C4AD15668BF9E8fFE99E93bdcABbDC7` for easy testing, but you can change it to any address and redeploy the contract.
